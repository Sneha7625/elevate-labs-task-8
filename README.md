## Objective
Create a **console-based quiz application** in Java that displays questions, accepts answers, and shows the user's final score.

---

## Tools Used
- Java
- Console (Command Line)

---

## Project Structure
OnlineQuizApp/
├── src/
│ ├── Question.java // Class to represent a quiz question
│ └── QuizApp.java // Main class to run the quiz
└── README.md // Project documentation


---

## How It Works

- The app uses a `List` of `Question` objects.
- Each question has multiple options.
- User is prompted to enter the answer (1-4).
- The app checks correctness and scores the user.
- At the end, the final score is displayed.

## Concepts Practiced

- Control flow (if-else, loops)
- Object-oriented programming (class, objects)
- Java Collections (`ArrayList`)
- Console input/output

---

## Outcome
- Strengthened logic and decision-making using Java.
- Applied OOP for modular question handling.
